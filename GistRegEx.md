# RegEx-MD

In the following gist I will break down and describe components to match an email in a regex. 

## Summary

The regular expression ```/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/``` matches an email address that consists of a username followed by an "@" symbol, a domain name, and a TLD part. A TLD is short for Top-Level domain and denotes the type of organization the domain belongs to. These include ".com", ".edu", or ".org". 
The username can be any combination of lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, dots, and hyphens.
